XPath 1.0  Data Model is based on 7 types of nodes 
 
 Data model: 
 
 Root node from XPATH does NOT represent Root Element. (The root element is the son of ROOT Node)
 Element
 Attribute
 Text
 Comment
 PI
 Namespace
 
 Datatypes accepted by XPath:
 
 node-set (it is an unordered set of nodes without duplicates --> processor takes care of removing the duplicates)
 boolean
 number
 string
 ------------
 In XPath we work with Expressions:
 Path Location Expression
 
 /step1/step2/..../stepn  (this is an example of an ABSOLUTE XPath expression and not RELATIVE, relative would be if "/" is missing, relative to the current node)
 
 one step is established from:
 
 axis:: nodetest[predicates]
 
 axis are predefined keywords and (desemneaza) direction in which the (avansare) is made.
 
 Parsing:
 
 top to bottom
 left to right
 
 Document order PARSING (see image attached) --> (can also go in REVERSES document order): 
 
			Root(1)
			
id="123"(3)   invoice(2)
			
		product(4)		product(9)
		
	code(5) price(7)	  code(10) price(12)
	XYZ(6)  1.25(8)	      ABC(11)  2.21(13)
